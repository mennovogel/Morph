# Morph

Morph is an Android library, written in Kotlin, built to work together with Jetpack Compose. It 
allows you to transition any view to another view by animating the size and the opacity, 
resulting in a crossfade animation. 

This library is currently supported on Android 5.0 Lollipop (21) and higher.
